He took off and he went to the underground house, to the people who were living there. “Aeh aeh”, said the crow, “I have come for Kíka7’s mek̓ilólya7, for her prepared salmon, her paint, aeh aeh”, said the crow. “Oh, poor guy, come in, come in.” Apparently, the people who were living there had heard him. “Come in, come in, poor thing.” Again, he said: “I have come to get Kíka7’s prepared salmon, her mek̓ilólya7, her paint.” Oh, poor thing, poor thing. “Come in.’ They took the salmon, the mek̓ilólya7, her paint. “Oh, go now.” He took off with those things and he brought them to the owl’s place, where he kept the girl.

Whatever that is, I don’t know. Nor did my grandmother tell me what a ‘skigw’ was. I guess that is what he made the girl into by keeping her as her wife.
